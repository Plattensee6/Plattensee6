Hi, I'm Tam√°s Balaton! :blush:
I'm a junior developer from Hungary, with a goal to bacome a backen developer. :sunglasses:

I've mostly used Java SE 8 and Jakarta, but I'm eager to learn almost almost anything. :innocent:
What a fraud I'm, writing those overused phrases like everyone else. :laughing:
Just kidding', I really have tons of motivation to learn new stuff.:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:


Currently I'm learning Spring and its subprojects (MVC, Security, etc.)
